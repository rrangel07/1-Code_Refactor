# Refactoring Horiseon Marketing Agency's Webpage

## Description

The purpose behind this project was to optimize the clients webpage for Search Engines. This was made enhancing the **accessibility** of Horiseon's webpage keeping the same design, as they requested. 

Basically, what we did was:
1. Improve the tittle of the website
2. Implement semantic elements, where they used to be 'div' tags, to make it friendly for users with disabilities
3. Fix some links to give access to the main sections of the site through the navigation bar
4. Include 'alt' properties to all images on the website
5. Consolidate repetitive CSS selectors and re-organize the CSS stylesheet to better match sections in html

## Mock-Up
